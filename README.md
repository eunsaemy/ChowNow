## Problem statement
In 2019, a woman in Ohio reported an incident of domestic abuse by pretending to order a pizza. THe discretion was imperative because the abuser was in the same room as her. After further research, we learned that domestic violence reports increase during large sporting events. As we proceeded throughout cmd-f, we asked ourselves: how might we provide victims of domestic violence a discreet way of reporting abuse?

## Research
We learned that during sporting events, sports enjoyers' plans typically involve food. The takeout application Deliveroo says that orders on their app rose on average by 25% during the hour prior to each of England’s Group Stage kickoffs, and the team’s final group match Vs. Belgium they claimed was their “busiest ever dinner service for a Thursday night.” We decided to amalgamate these two spaces to create a solution for victims to request for help, disguised in the form of a typical takeout delivery application to not risk the suspicion of their abusers.

## Introducing Chow Now
Chow Now is an application that collects the necessary information from domestic violence victims in order to quickly inform their emergency contacts when the victim needs help. The victim can request for help in a way that does not raise the suspicion of their abuser, because the user can disguise the application to appear like a typical takeout delivery application.

### How we built it
Chow Now was designed with Figma and Adobe Illustrator and designed with images from Freepik. As for our technology stack, we built our demo with React Native, Twilio, JavaScript, and Google Firebase.
